# LaTeX for you!

The purpose of this workshop is to help you get started on using Latex. 

We will cover the basics of:

* What is Latex and how it works
* Creating your document: most used commands and environments
* Writing math - it looks pretty!
* Bibliography and indexes

If time allows we will see a bit on graphics!

**Please make sure you have LaTeX installed in your machine beforehand.** Choosing an editor would be nice too - there are many free ones available!
